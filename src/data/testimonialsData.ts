    text: "As a newcomer to the industry, I was fortunate enough to have Gi play a pivotal role in my growth as both a software engineer and a colleague. Her dynamic and positive personality made her a pleasure to work alongside every day, while her extensive healthcare background brought invaluable perspective to our projects. She consistently helped bridge the gap between code and real-world impact, offering insights that enhanced both the quality of our work and my personal understanding of its broader significance.\n\nGi’s diverse experience was evident in her thoughtful approach to problem-solving and her natural ability to mentor others. She encouraged me to think creatively, push boundaries, and work independently, which ultimately empowered me to take on larger responsibilities and confidently lead projects.\n\nWhat stands out most about Gi is her unwavering commitment to excellence. Given the opportunity, I have no doubt that she will not only meet expectations but exceed them. My time working with her has proven that her potential to grow, inspire, and mentor others is truly limitless.",
